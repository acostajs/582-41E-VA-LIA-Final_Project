		"role": "Full-Stack Developer",
		"type": "Academic project (Freelancer simulation)",
		"audience": ["Recruiters", "Instructors", "Developers"],
		"status": "Ongoing"
	},

	"overview": {
		"summary": "A full-stack Django e-commerce application built as a freelance-style upgrade of a ceramic artist’s portfolio site, deployed on Render with cloud-based storage and database services.",
		"problem": "The original site functioned only as a static portfolio and lacked product management, payments, persistent data storage, and scalable media handling.",
		"solution": "A complete Django-based e-commerce experience with product collections, Stripe Checkout integration, cloud-hosted PostgreSQL for structured data, and AWS S3 for scalable image storage."
	},

	"responsibilities": [
		"Planned and implemented the full-stack architecture based on a simulated client brief",
		"Built Django models for products, collections, and contact submissions",
		"Integrated Stripe Checkout for secure payment processing in test mode",
		"Configured AWS S3 for handling product image uploads and media storage",
		"Set up PostgreSQL as the primary database for production deployment on Render",
		"Developed accessible, responsive templates using Django and Tailwind CSS"
	],

	"architecture": {
		"approach": "Modular Django application with clear separation between models, views, templates, and configuration, designed to reflect real-world freelance delivery and production constraints.",
		"data_flow": "Product, collection, and contact data are persisted in a PostgreSQL database; media assets are stored in AWS S3 and served externally; Stripe handles payment flow externally while order intent is managed internally.",
		"deployment": "Deployed on Render with environment-based configuration, using PostgreSQL for production data and AWS S3 for scalable, persistent image storage."
	},
